## prologue
- [formal languages](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/formal-informal-languages/) are more stuctured where [DALL-E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DALL-E#:~:text=The%20original%20DALL%C2%B7E%20was,3%20modified%20to%20generate%20images.) talks to the person.
  > the language you need to know to talk to DALL-E. Right now, it’s an informal language, not a formal language with a specification in *BNF* or some other metalanguage.
  BNF adds [much limitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form).

- [logic](https://web.archive.org/web/20071218193638/https://www.utm.edu/research/iep/a/aristotl.htm#H5)
  > The heart of Aristotle's logic is the syllogism, the classic example of which is as follows
- "p only if q" means only if q is true, p can be true.
- compare TABLE 5 and TABLE 6, the "p if q" changes one `F` to `T`.
- p54
  $p\to q\equiv \neg p \vee q$ because they are both 3 false and 1 true property.

  $Q_4$ implies all [anti-diagonals](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/return-an-array-of-anti-diagonals-of-given-nn-square-matrix/)

### TODO
# miscs links from [this](https://semmedia.mhhe.com/math/Rosen_8e/CHAPTER_1_LINKS.html)
- [atlas](https://web.archive.org/web/20060106014447/http:/www.math.niu.edu:80/~rusin/known-math/index/03-XX.html)
# how I read the information center
- [links](https://semmedia.mhhe.com/math/Rosen_8e/CHAPTER_1_LINKS.html) are too miscellaneous so I skipped them except when I can't understand the book reference point.
- most of [Extra Examples](https://highered.mheducation.com/sites/125967651x/student_view0/extra_examples.html) are similar to book corresponding ones based on chapter 1 observation, so I skipped all of them.
# anecdotes of famous mathematicians, etc
- [John Tukey](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Tukey/)
  > Their educational method was to respond to John's queries by providing clues and asking *further* questions rather than giving a direct answer, a characteristic that John inherited and used throughout his career.
  > John also had the benefit of an excellent *public library* in New Bedford which even possessed *journals* such as the Journal of the American Chemical Society and the Transactions of the American Mathematical Society. He was able therefore to take his education to a high level *before* entering university
# Exercises
I only read even ones because [they][SOLUTIONS_8th] have detailed explanation as [7th][SOLUTIONS_7th] and also odd ones are very similar to even ones at least for 1.1 (except for some cases that even ones are a little hard whether having asterisk marks or not).
I also read the asterisked ones.
- I skipped all [assessments](https://highered.mheducation.com/sites/125967651x/student_view0/self_assessments.html) because examples plus exercises are enough.
## 1
### 1.1
- [x] 
  a,b,d,f not.
- 4~16,
  24~40,46 skipped for it to be a little too unnecessary and trivial.
- see answer for 18
- [ ] a,b true because premise is false.
- [ ] a,b,c -> inclusive or
- [x] 42 assume one pair is different, then can be proved easily.
  if they are all same, it is also easy to prove the equation holds.
- [x] 44 because if not, then one pair of all true will make the statement false.
- [ ] 45 $\underset{i=1}{{\overset{n-1}{\bigvee}}}\underset{j=i+1}{{\overset{n}{\bigvee}}}$
- [ ] 52 yes
- [ ] 53
  a) only one is true
  b) undetermined value
  c) 
  modification after reading the answer
  a) so 99th is true
  b) if "at least n" is true, then true for all $i<=n$ (i.e. n false and $100-n$ true -> $100-n=n$ -> $n=50$)
  c) see b), $99-n=n$ is impossible for $n\in\mathbb{Z}$
### 1.2
- 2,6~8,12 skipped because similar to 10,
  14 just based on keywords
  18 (because not automatic proof, it just traverses all conditions)
  24 (just use the exhaustion method)
  28~35 they are similar to 24,26 and they have little differences among themselves.
- [ ] 4 $d\vee s \to w$
- [ ] 10 yes TFT (maybe true)
- [ ] 19 the 2rd subquestion is to test [whether the man is liar](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/2346364/1059606) based on 1st, [detailed](https://stackoverflow.com/a/34574728/21294350).
  more [intuitive](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/3021648/1059606) where no/yes from whether liar or TRUTHTELLER is *same*.
- [ ] 20
  1. if "yes", then he is liar -> he is not liar based on contrary "yes", i.e. no. (Then contradiction)
    "no" is ~~similar~~.
  2. 
  - Ans
    1. Above is wrong.
    2. similar to 19.
- [ ] 22 TFF
  ~~TODO how~~ “unless” 
  1. means “or.”
  2. `->` based on p30.
  TODO IMHO, should be $p\to q$, i.e. $\neg j\to \neg k$
- [ ] 26 two cases (both knights / both knaves) are possible.
- [ ] 36
  since what Smith said is neutral, so assume he is true.
  if Jones is true, then Williams is wrong.
  - ans
    ~~b) just same as a) because the added statements is obvious.~~
- [ ] 38 can also use $\oplus$
- [ ] 40 also "the exhaustion method".
- [ ] TODO 42 [unavailable](https://web.archive.org/web/20020401000000*/http://mathforum.org/dr.math/problems/joseph8.5.97.html)
  based on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebra_Puzzle#Solution), just step by step solve the problem.
  TODO where is in [Life International](https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=elIEAAAAMBAJ&q=zebra#v=onepage&q=zebra&f=false)
### 1.3
- 2~12,18,
  50~52 are skipped.
  14,16 I only read the 1st one.
  20~37 I only read 20 because they are probably similar.
- [x] 19 $p=T,q=F$
  $p\to q$ is $F$
  then $F\to F$ is true
- [ ] 40 has no referenced symbols.
  TODO
  1. the ans doesn't show the compound proposition, also for the above self answer.
- [ ] 42 TODO why they are held simultaneously.
- [x] 44 obviously by $\wedge$.
- [ ] 46 just based on the meaning of disjunction and conjunctions
  where disjunction allows all possibilities
  and conjunction ensures the needed conditions with one specific possibility.
- [x] 48 the hint has given the answer.
  49 just the opposite step of 48.
- [x] 54
  a. truth table
  b. $\neg (p\downarrow q)\ldots$
  c. based on 49 and the above is enough.
- [x] 55 $\neg(\neg p\downarrow q)$
  then $((p\downarrow p)\downarrow q)\downarrow((p\downarrow p)\downarrow q)$
- [x] 56 same as $\downarrow$
  $p|p=\neg p$
  $(p|q)|(p|q)=\neg (p|q)=p\wedge q$
  - the ans based on $\vee$ is also ok.
- [ ] 58 see the answer.
- [x] 59 $2^4$
- [x] 60 transitivity.
- [x] 62 5
- [x] 64 $\neg F=T; \neg T=F$
- [x] 66
  a($p=T,s=F$),b($p=F=s,q=T$),c($p=T=q=s,r=F$)
- [ ] 68 $Q\bigwedge\underset{i\in odd}{\bigvee}p(i,1)$
  all is not in even -> in one of odd.
- [x] 70 $\underset{i=1}{\overset{9}{\bigwedge}}\underset{j=1}{\overset{9}{\bigwedge}}\underset{n=1}{\overset{9}{\bigvee}}p(i,j,n)$
- [x] 72
  where $r,s$ traverse the 9 blocks
  $n$ ensures each number is assigned
  $i,j$ traverse inside the block
### 1.4
1. [null quantification](https://gateoverflow.in/130504/null-qunatification-rule#:~:text=Null%20Quantification%20mean%20when%20a,in%20part%20of%20a%20statement.) means some statement like $A$ in 48 doesn't have quantified variable like $x$ in 48.
- 2~6,
  12~16,
  22,26,
  28~30(similar to exercises before),
  32~44,54,
  58~64 skipped
- [x] 8
  a. rabbit hops
  b. all animals are rabbits and hops
  c. there is some animals are rabbits and they hop.
  d. there is some animals are rabbits which hop.
- [ ] 10 better with parentheses
  a. $\exists xC(x)\wedge D(x)\wedge F(x)$
  b. $\forall xC(x)\wedge D(x)\wedge F(x)$ wrong ("or")
  c. $\exists xC(x)\wedge \neg D(x)\wedge F(x)$ 
  d. $\neg (\exists xC(x)\wedge D(x)\wedge F(x))$
  e. $\exists xC(x)\vee D(x)\vee F(x)$ This is same as the answer.
- [x] 18
  $\exists \to \vee$
  $\forall \to \wedge$
  $\neg$ just assign to each predicate
- [x] 20 
  a,b similar to 18
  c~e see the ans is enough.
- [x] 24
  same as the examples,
  $\forall \to \to$ to exclude the result as the condition
  $\exists \to \wedge$ to include the result as the condition -> b,c,e
- [ ] 46 yes based on 45.
  45 is by definition.
  - 45 ans
    $T/F \to  F$ false because $T\to F$ is false
    $F\to F$ true
  - 46 similar
- [ ] 48 by definition
  a. any ... or ... means any (... or ...)
- [x] 50
  a. only A is T and P(x) is F -> false
    same for the right side, Q.E.D
- [ ] 52 -> ans
- [ ] 56
  inspired by p57
  at least $\underset{i=1}{\overset{3}{\bigvee}}P(i)$
  at most $\underset{i=1}{\overset{2}{\bigwedge}}\underset{j=i+1}{\overset{3}{\bigwedge}}(\neg P(i)\wedge \neg P(j))$
  - ans just the exhaustion method
### 1.5
- 2~8,
  14~32,
  36~42,46,52(similar to 17) are skipped
- [ ] 10
  PO IMHO here $\rightarrow$ can also be $\leftrightarrow$
- [ ] 12
  j. here chat -> connection is wrong so no $\leftarrow$
  k. maybe here ~~assume~~ self has chatted with self is nonsense. ~~so not chat ~~can't~~ -> $x\neq y$~~
  so $x\neq y$ is just the condition and should be thought as the result, so no $\leftarrow$
- [ ] 17
  d. $\exists x \exists y (x\neq y\wedge\forall z(M(x,z)\wedge M(y,z)))\wedge \forall a(\forall z M(a,z)\to (x=a\vee y=a))$
  - the ans is more elegant.
- [x] 34
  just $1,2$
  and $1,2,3$
- [ ] 44
  also can use methods similar to 17.
- [x] 48 replace $x$ with $y$ and then truth table
- [ ] 49 similar to 48
  a. since $P(x)=T$, so become $\exists xQ(x)$ -> $\exists yQ(y)$
  b. similar to a
- [ ] 50
  a. $\exists x(P(x)\vee Q(x) \vee A)$
  | x   | P(x) | Q(x) |
  | --- | ---- | ---- |
  | x1  | T    | F    |
  | x2  | F    | T    |
  | ... |      |      |

  b. $\exists x \neg(P(x)\vee Q(x))$
  c. see ans.
  $\neg (\exists xP(x)\wedge(\neg \exists xQ(x)))$ ->
  $\neg (\exists xP(x)\wedge(\forall x \neg Q(x)))$ ->
  $\forall x \neg P(x) \vee(\exists x Q(x))$
- [ ] 51
  by 50 and exercises before
  1. connectives are enough for $\neg,\vee$
  2. 50 has includes $\exists,\forall,\to$
  then Q.E.D
  - The ans proves that 
    1. $QxP(x)$
    2. $\neg P(x)$
    3. $P\vee Q$
    all be transformed into PNF
    Then based on the *order*, just one by one transform is enough.
