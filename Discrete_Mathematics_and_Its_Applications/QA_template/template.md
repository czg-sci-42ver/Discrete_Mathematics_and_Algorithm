Recently, when I self-learned Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications 8th by Kenneth Rosen, I did only the even-numbered exercises which the author offers the detailed description than the odd ones because the odd ones and the corresponding even ones are very similar. I was stuck at exercise 2.3-72.

The problem is
> Suppose that f is an invertible function from Y to Z and
g is an invertible function from X to Y. Show that the
inverse of the composition $f\circ g$ is given by $(f\circ g)^{-1}=g^{-1}\circ f^{-1}$

I found one similar [QA](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1267985/1059606) which same as the book corresponding solution proves both $(f\circ g)\circ (g^{-1}\circ f^{-1})$ and $(g^{-1}\circ f^{-1})\circ (f\circ g)$.

But IMHO, for the inverse function, one case is enough, since for the inverse function $(f\circ f^{-1})(x)=x$, then let $g=f^{-1}$
