# Discrete_Mathematics_and_Algorithm
CRLS and Discrete_Mathematicsand_Its_Applications book notes
# How I chose the textbooks
- from [teachyourselfcs](https://teachyourselfcs.com/#algorithms), the 2 books it recommends don't have full solutions for corresponding exercises (1. [The Algorithm Design Manual](https://www.algorist.com/algowiki/index.php/Solution_Wiki,_The_Algorithm_Design_Manual,_3rd_Edition) 2. MIT related book [2015](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-spring-2015/resources/mit6_042js15_textbook/) or [github](https://github.com/spamegg1/Math-for-CS-solutions/blob/master/inclass-questions/MIT6_042JS15_cp3_solutions.pdf)).
  - So I chose Discrete Mathematics and its Applications by [this](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/2312/1059606) with full [solutions](https://www.reddit.com/r/textbookrequest/comments/qdoxej/comment/i80ryh5/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
    and CRLS 4th with almost [full 3rd solutions](https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~ajl213/CLRS/CLRS.html).
- More detailed see [this](https://github.com/czg-sci-42ver/csapp3e/blob/master/asm/README.md#algorithms-and-data-structures) related contexts.
